## 🚀 Projects

### 🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction System 

🔹 Developed an AI-powered healthcare prediction system capable of predicting Diabetes, Liver, Stroke, Kidney, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, and more using patient input data.

🔹 Implemented machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, XGboost, SVM, Random Forest, etc.) trained on open-source medical datasets.

🔹 Integrated all models into a single Streamlit-based web app with an interactive UI.

🔹 Deployed the app on Streamlit Cloud for public access and usage.

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Pickle
